bio:`I was born in western New York state where I lived until I moved to Bolivar Missouri (yikes) until I went off to college, quit college and moved to Boston in 2001.
I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Massachusetts Boston, then graduate school at Tufts Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and finally I worked as a post doctoral student at The Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at Harvard Medical School.

After a couple of years I used my skill in interpreting genomic variants to join a small start up called Tempus labs. It's been five years and I have expanded the breadth of my understanding in genetics and have fostered emergent coding skills. I have used those skills to create new assays, support automation in production, and improve processes in between.

I'm really excited about the future in genetics and web development. I hope to find a really great position where I can use my fantastic scientific knowledge to inform data analysis, display and the development of modern web applications to view and use the data.`,
